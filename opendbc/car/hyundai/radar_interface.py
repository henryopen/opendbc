    speed that is not there. Measured against a centred +-1.5 s fit of the range, on the one
    target radard follows, with a slow or stopped car ahead: differentiating called it
    'opening' by more than 2 m/s on 5.1% of frames, which is the planner being told to
    accelerate towards a stationary car. Reading V_ABS does that on none of them, and its
    p90 error is 1.26 m/s against 3.03. Lengthening the window instead only trades the
    error for lag (0.9 s: 2.2% opening, but 8.5% falsely closing against 7.1%).
